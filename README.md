# tintin-kallisti-pack
A feature pack for the Legends of Kallisti, using the TinTin client.
Code contributions are welcome. For feature requests or bugs, please use 
the issues fiture on GitHub, as those will be given max priority.

##Dependencies
This pack will ue Sox for playing audio files. Please install that in 
your favorite repo. I don't have a Windows or Macintosh machine to test 
the pack with, so 
I am unaware of what is necessary in order to get the pack working.
